Even though human sentiments are unpredictable and unassuming, it is practical for an AI model to be ready to unequivocally perceive a lot of sentiments which can be isolated from each other with explicit looks.
Our model having the precision around 80% can distinguish the emotion of the face and also can detect multiple facial emotion in one frame.
As we have used spotify dashboard API as our song recommendation system which recommends song playlists which is already build by other users or by themselves with proper accuracy.  
Can build the playlist more effective by doing some research on human emotion psychology and with proper scientific approach.
